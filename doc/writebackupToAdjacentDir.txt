*writebackupToAdjacentDir.txt*       Backup to an adjacent backup directory.

		WRITEBACKUP TO ADJACENT DIR    by Ingo Karkat

Redirect backups made by the writebackup plugin that would normally go into
the original file's directory into an adjacent directory with a "{dir}.backup"
name, if it exists. This allows to use the plugin in places where backup files
would cause problems.

DESCRIPTION				*writebackupToAdjacentDir-description*

Many customization directories (e.g. /etc/profile.d/) consider all contained
files, regardless of file extension or execute permissions. Creating a
{file}.YYYYMMDD[a-z] backup in there causes trouble and strange effects,
because the backups are used in addition to the main configuration file - not
what was intended! However, putting the backups in the same directory
generally is a good idea - just not for these special directories.

This plugin offers a solution by integrating into the |writebackup.vim| plugin
so that it checks for a directory with a '.backup' extension (e.g.
/etc/profile.d.backup/), and places the backups in there, in case it exists.
In all other cases, the backup is made in the default directory, as before.

==============================================================================
USAGE					      *writebackupToAdjacentDir-usage*

Adjacent backup directories are never created by this plugin; you have to
create such a directory yourself to indicate that backups should be placed in
there.
						 *:WriteBackupMakeAdjacentDir*
:WriteBackupMakeAdjacentDir [../..|/path/to/dir] [{prot}]
		Create a backup directory adjacent to the current file's
		directory, or in a parent of that ("..", "../..", etc.), or of
		any passed directory.
		If {prot} is given it is used to set the protection bits;
		default is 0755.

After the adjacent backup directory has been created, just use |:WriteBackup|
as before.

==============================================================================
INSTALLATION			       *writebackupToAdjacentDir-installation*

This script is packaged as a |vimball|. If you have the "gunzip" decompressor
in your PATH, simply edit the *.vmb.gz package in Vim; otherwise, decompress
the archive first, e.g. using WinZip. Inside Vim, install by sourcing the
vimball or via the |:UseVimball| command. >
    vim writebackupToAdjacentDir*.vmb.gz
    :so %
To uninstall, use the |:RmVimball| command.

DEPENDENCIES			       *writebackupToAdjacentDir-dependencies*

- Requires Vim 7.0 or higher.
- Requires the |ingo-library.vim| plugin (vimscript #4433), version 1.011 or
  higher.
- Requires the |writebackup.vim| plugin (vimscript #1828), version 1.30 or
  higher.
- The |writebackupVersionControl.vim| plugin (vimscript #1829), which
  complements |writebackup.vim|, fully supports this extension, but is not
  required.

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION			      *writebackupToAdjacentDir-configuration*

For a permanent configuration, put the following commands into your |vimrc|:

				  *g:WriteBackupAdjacentDir_BackupDirTemplate*
To change the name of the adjacent backup directory, specify a different
template via >
    let g:WriteBackupAdjacentDir_BackupDirTemplate = '%s.backup'
This must contain the "%s" placeholder, which is replaced with the original
file's directory, e.g. "backup of %s".
					  *g:WriteBackupAdjacentDir_BackupDir*
This plugin injects itself into |writebackup.vim| via the
|g:WriteBackup_BackupDir| configuration. Its previous value is saved in
|g:WriteBackupAdjacentDir_BackupDir| and used as a fallback, when no adjacent
directory exists. If you need to change the fallback after sourcing the
plugins, use the latter variable. However, to override this for a particular
buffer, you still have to use the |b:WriteBackup_BackupDir| variable, as this
plugin does not provide yet another override.

			*g:WriteBackupAdjacentDir_IsUpwardsBackupDirSearch*
By default, the plugin also searches for backup directories in upper
directories (until it reaches the file system root), and then re-creates the
path to the current file inside that parallel backup directory hierarchy. If
you want to revert to the version 1.x behavior of the plugin, turn this off
via: >
    let g:WriteBackupAdjacentDir_IsUpwardsBackupDirSearch = 0

HISTORY					    *writebackupToAdjacentDir-history*

2.01	29-Jan-2014
- Compatibility: Fix Funcref errors for Vim 7.0/1.

2.00	02-Aug-2013
- ENH: Implement upwards directory hierarchy search for backup directories,
  and then re-create the path to the current file inside that parallel backup
  directory hierarchy.
- ENH: :WriteBackupMakeAdjacentDir now optionally also takes a target
  directory to better support the new upwards directory hierarchy search.
- Abort :WriteBackupMakeAdjacentDir on error.
- Add dependency to ingo-library (vimscript #4433). *** You need to separately
  install ingo-library (vimscript #4433) version 1.011 (or higher)! ***

1.10	17-Feb-2012
ENH: Save configured g:WriteBackup_BackupDir and use that as a fallback
instead of always defaulting to '.', thereby allowing absolute and dynamic
backup directories as a fallback. Suggested by Geoffrey Nimal.

1.00	02-Jun-2010
First published version.

0.01	01-Jun-2010
Started development.
