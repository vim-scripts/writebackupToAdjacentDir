		WRITEBACKUP TO ADJACENT DIR    by Ingo Karkat

Redirect backups made by the writebackup plugin that would normally go into
the original file's directory into an adjacent directory with a "{dir}.backup"
name, if it exists. This allows to use the plugin in places where backup files
would cause problems.

DESCRIPTION				*writebackupToAdjacentDir-description*

Many customization directories (e.g. /etc/profile.d/) consider all contained
files, regardless of file extension or execute permissions. Creating a
{file}.YYYYMMDD[a-z] backup in there causes trouble and strange effects,
because the backups are used in addition to the main configuration file - not
what was intended! However, putting the backups in the same directory
generally is a good idea - just not for these special directories. 

This plugin offers a solution by integrating into the |writebackup.vim| plugin
so that it checks for a directory with a '.backup' extension (e.g.
/etc/profile.d.backup/), and places the backups in there, in case it exists.
In all other cases, the backup is made in the default directory, as before. 

==============================================================================
USAGE					      *writebackupToAdjacentDir-usage*

Adjacent backup directories are never created by this plugin; you have to
create such a directory yourself to indicate that backups should be placed in
there. 
						 *:WriteBackupMakeAdjacentDir*
:WriteBackupMakeAdjacentDir [{prot}]
		Create a backup directory adjacent to the current file's
		directory. If {prot} is given it is used to set the protection
		bits; default is 0755. 

After the adjacent backup directory has been created, just use |:WriteBackup|
as before. 

==============================================================================
INSTALLATION			       *writebackupToAdjacentDir-installation*

This script is packaged as a |vimball|. If you have the "gunzip" decompressor
in your PATH, simply edit the *.vba.gz package in Vim; otherwise, decompress
the archive first, e.g. using WinZip. Inside Vim, install by sourcing the
vimball or via the |:UseVimball| command. >
    vim writebackupToAdjacentDir.vba.gz
    :so %
To uninstall, use the |:RmVimball| command. 

DEPENDENCIES			       *writebackupToAdjacentDir-dependencies*

- Requires Vim 7.0 or higher. 
- Requires the |writebackup.vim| plugin (vimscript #1828), version 1.30 or
  higher. 
- The |writebackupVersionControl.vim| plugin (vimscript #1829), which
  complements |writebackup.vim|, fully supports this extension, but is not
  required. 

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION			      *writebackupToAdjacentDir-configuration*

For a permanent configuration, put the following commands into your |vimrc|:

				  *g:WriteBackupAdjacentDir_BackupDirTemplate*
To change the name of the adjacent backup directory, specify a different
template via >
    let g:WriteBackupAdjacentDir_BackupDirTemplate = '%s.backup'
This must contain the "%s" placeholder, which is replaced with the original
file's directory, e.g. "backup of %s". 
					  *g:WriteBackupAdjacentDir_BackupDir*
This plugin injects itself into |writebackup.vim| via the
|g:WriteBackup_BackupDir| configuration. Its previous value is saved in
|g:WriteBackupAdjacentDir_BackupDir| and used as a fallback, when no adjacent
directory exists. If you need to change the fallback after sourcing the
plugins, use the latter variable. However, to override this for a particular
buffer, you still have to use the |b:WriteBackup_BackupDir| variable, as this
plugin does not provide yet another override. 

==============================================================================
LIMITATIONS				*writebackupToAdjacentDir-limitations*

KNOWN PROBLEMS			     *writebackupToAdjacentDir-known-problems*

TODO					       *writebackupToAdjacentDir-todo*

- Support adjacent backup directories higher up in the directory hierarchy,
  using finddir() to locate them.

HISTORY					    *writebackupToAdjacentDir-history*

1.10	17-Feb-2012
ENH: Save configured g:WriteBackup_BackupDir and use that as a fallback
instead of always defaulting to '.', thereby allowing absolute and dynamic
backup directories as a fallback. Suggested by Geoffrey Nimal.
